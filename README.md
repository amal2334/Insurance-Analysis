#  Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing insurance policyholder and claim data to help an insurance company make **data-driven business decisions**.  
The objective was to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that consolidates data from multiple sources, tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualizes trends in claims, demographics, and risk exposure.

---

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered policy and claim datasets from different internal sources. 
2. **Data Modeling:** Created a star schema model linking policy and claim data for better filtering and analysis.  
3. **KPI Development:** Built DAX measures to calculate total policies, total claim amount, average claim amount, and claim frequency.  
4. **Dashboard Design:** Developed interactive Power BI visuals for demographic, geographic, and vehicle-based analysis.

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Policies** – Measures the size of the active customer base.  
- **Total Claim Amount** – Tracks the overall financial exposure.  
- **Claim Frequency** – Measures how often claims are filed.  
- **Average Claim Amount** – Evaluates the severity of claims.  
- **Gender-wise Total Policies** – Understands customer segmentation by gender.

##  Dashboard Visualizations
- **By Car Use (Donut Chart)** – Policy distribution by car usage (personal vs. commercial).  
- **By Car Make (Bar Chart)** – Claims and policies grouped by car manufacturer.  
- **By Coverage Zone (Donut Chart)** – Policies and claims by geographic zone.  
- **By Age Group (Histogram)** – Policyholder age distribution and claim trends.  
- **By Car Year (Area Chart)** – Impact of vehicle age on policies and claims.  
- **By Kids Driving (Ribbon Chart)** – Compares households with and without young drivers.  
- **By Education (Pie Chart)** – Policies distribution by education level.  
- **By Education & Marital Status (Matrix Heat Grid)** – Combined demographic analysis.

---

##  Key Insights
- Younger policyholders and families with kids driving show higher claim frequency.  
- Commercial vehicle usage results in higher average claim amounts.  
- Specific car brands contribute to more claims, highlighting brand-based risks.  
- Higher education levels correlate with lower claim frequency.  
- Regional differences indicate areas of higher risk and potential pricing optimization.
